The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. _x000D_<br/>We werenâ€™t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   _x000D_<br/>After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. _x000D_<br/>We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. _x000D_<br/>The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are â€œspecialâ€\\x9d adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  _x000D_<br/>A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! _x000D_<br/>',\n \"Jennifer's place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.

I had a great time there.',\n \"Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!\",\n \"Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.\",\n 'The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy! She gave us all of the information we needed for a smooth trip.  I would highly recommend this place to other visitors, and would consider staying there again when we are back in NYC!',\n 'Tiene una ubicaciÃ³n excelente. Buen equipamiento del apartamento.

Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk.

In any case itâ€™s a good workout :)',\n \"Jennifer's space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!\",\n 'This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.',\n 'Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!',\n 'Location Location Location.<br/>Outstanding location near to everything walking, by train or bus.<br/>We enjoy our rent there.<br/><br/>Alonso',\n 'Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.',\n 'We really enjoyed our stay at Jenniferâ€™s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. <br/>The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment',\n 'This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.',\n 'The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. ',\n 'Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However <br/>- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor<br/>- the building is very old. <br/>- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. <br/><br/>However. We do appreciate the stay and the location',\n 'Jennifer es un anfitriÃ³n increÃ\\xadble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dejÃ³ listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta.

I will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC',\n 'The location made getting to Time Square easily accessible. Apartment was quiet and no disturbances from neighbors at all.',\n 'Jenniferâ€™s place is a wonderful retreat in the middle of the busy city. The bed was super comfy- and the whole space/energy of the place felt very calm and cozy. You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night. Jennifer was kind enough to leave ear plugs in case we needed them but we never did. I definitely recommend her place!',\n 'Great place to stay, very good host',\n 'Jenniferâ€™s place is beautiful, cozy and very well located.

Loved the lighting options for the space and the skylight.',\n \"The apartment met expectations to how it was insinuated on the ad. Jennifer is very welcoming and friendly. A little pricey for a <500 sq ft space, but it is a convenient location. If you don't want to walk up a 4 story stair case after an already long day of walking, this place is not for you.\",\n '10 / 10 would stay again',\n 'Place was so cute and comfy! Host was great and was quick to communicate when I had questions. Quick walk to the subway and only about 5 min walk to the Empire State Building. Overall great stay and host was amazing!',\n \"I'm glad I stayed here. I liked everything.<br/>The apartment is quite spacious and comfortable with an extraordinary glass roof.<br/>A beautiful reflection of the Empire State Building can be seen in the window.<br/>Excellent location in the center of Manhattan, a few minutes walk to the excellent Bryant Park and to the Whole Foods Market.<br/>Jeniffer is very friendly, on the last day when my flight was delayed  she was not against my late check out. I appreciate it.\",\n 'First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didnâ€™t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. <br/><br/>For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. <br/>The place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. <br/>The kitchen was clean and well equipped. <br/>Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. <br/><br/>Also, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion.',\n 'Great location, convenient to everything. Very cool space and building.',\n \"Jennifer's apartment is a well-cared for studio in the heart of midtown Garment District, just a few blocks from Bryant Park. The huge skylight is so nice. The quality of light in the early afternoon is idyllic. It has a casual vibe with sound healing instruments, a bean bag chair, and eclectic decÃ³r. The A.C. works great. Jennifer was very friendly and inviting.<br/><br/>Midtown is well-known for its business + tourist vibe. The theatre district is a short walk away. Restaurants are plentiful, though the food is geared towards fast and American. I ate better when I just went for the higher end restaurants, as the quality of the others is questionable. (Hidden by Airbnb) reviews of restaurants in the area are inflated. Korea town is a few blocks away and has some better options. Check out Tonchin (best ramen), Fine & Rare (live jazz), and further north, Tao (cavernous Asian Fusion restaurant with a colossal Buddha statue), for unforgettable dining experiences. Culture on 38th is the best coffee shop around.<br/><br/>The apartment has no blackout curtains so expect a good amount of light 24/7. If you're light sensitive like me, this can be a problem. I slept with a sleep mask every night. Thankfully it wasn't noisy at night, other than the occasional garbage truck.<br/><br/>Lastly, something that Jennifer worked valorously to correct, but you should be aware of, is that there is a light odor from the pipes in the bathroom sometimes. The only way to tame the beast is to keep the fan on continuously, otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Hopefully she can get to the root of the problem, and it may be completely fixed soon after I write this review.<br/><br/>Overall, Jennifer's apartment is a unique find that will be a welcome escape from busy, touristy midtown. I especially recommend it for those who are not light- and smell-sensitive, and who like a casual space instilled with positive intentions.\",\n 'Simple place, super nice guy.',\n 'Great guy with a basic room.

Was happy to find street parking in a safe neighborhood.@Clean, quiet, well-run home, very close to the subway@John was always responsive during my stay. He answers back immediately when you request something from him. The neighborhood is very calm and secure. The rooms are clean and John does his best to make comfortable your stay. It takes approximately 45 minutes by subway to reach Manhattan mid-town and the house is located one block to the subway station. I recommend John\\'s place.@Notre sÃ©jour de trois nuits._x000D_<br/>Nous avons apprÃ©cier L\\'appartement qui est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©. AgrÃ©able, propre et bien soignÃ©. C\\'est idÃ©al pour une famille de 3 ou 4 personnes._x000D_<br/>Petits soucis en arrivant il y avait personne pour nous recevoir, et il manquait le savon pour la douche, le liquide vaisselle, nous les avons reÃ§u de surlendemain. Il y a aussi le bruit du MÃ©tro de NY, donc une premiÃ¨re nuit difficile si on est pas habituÃ©. Jennifer est correcte le remboursement de la caution Ã©tait trÃ¨s rapide.  A part ces petits dÃ©tails notre court sÃ©jour c\\'est bien passÃ©. _x000D_<br/>Si j\\'ai la possibilitÃ© de revenir sur NY pour les vacances, je reprendrai Ã\\xa0 \"The Midtown Castle\"_x000D_<br/>Jean_x000D_<br/>Possession - Ile de La RÃ©union_x000D_<br/>@Great experience.@I\\'ve stayed with my friend at the Midtown Castle for six days and it was a lovely place to be. A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy\\'s Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York._x000D_<br/>Attention: it\\'s on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!@We\\'ve been staying here for about 9 nights, enjoying to be in the center of the city, that never sleeps...short ways to everywhere in Manhattan, by subway or by walk. Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too!@We had a wonderful stay at Jennifer\\'s charming apartment! They were very organized and helpful; I would definitely recommend staying at the Midtown Castle!@Hi to everyone!_x000D_<br/>Would say our greatest compliments to Jennifer, the host of Midtown Castle. We spent in this lovely apartment in the heart of Manhattan one month (April, 2012) and will remember this time as ours best._x000D_<br/>The apartment is pretty spacious and great located - the 5-th Ave right around the corner. There is everything you can need during your short or long stay. Jennifer is very friendly, vigorous and very responsible host. Thanks her and highly recomend this apartment for everyone who are looking for a quiet place right in the center of the boiling Midtown!@Jennifer was very friendly and helpful, and her place is exactly as advertised. The location is very convenient, and it was a pleasure to stay at the Midtown Castle. I definitely recommend it :)_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Thanks !@This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. _x000D_<br/>We werenâ€™t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   _x000D_<br/>After we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. _x000D_<br/>We had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. _x000D_<br/>The apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are â€œspecialâ€\\x9d adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  _x000D_<br/>A deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! _x000D_<br/>@Jennifer\\'s place was in a great midtown location, close to the subway, Bryant Park and Times Square.  She met us after midnight to give us keys to the place, which we appreciated._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The apartment is spacious for two people; a deli next door is perfect for last minute toiletries._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Thanks for allowing us to stay!@Jennifer is a very nice host. Everything is clean and she really takes care of her guests. We can only recommend her apartment to others.@This is a cute studio in a wonderful location with some quirky and interesting traits including a giant translucent skylight (makes the neatest noise when rain falls on it, sounds like clapping!), warm couch, and trinkets that are fun (hoola hoops, juggling pins? sure, why not!?). _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Great place, great location!@A great location, a very comfortable space and a helpful host. Everything that makes Airbnb great!@Jennifer\\'s place is cozy and a short walking distance from Time Square. The place was big enough for two. _x000D_<br/>Jennifer left detailed instructions and was also helpful in terms of recommending great places in NY._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Everything was great:)@We hebben genoten van ons verblijf in het appartement van Jennifer. Prima en centraal gelegen, ook t.o.v. openbaar vervoer. Het daklicht maakt dat het prettig licht is en ruim aanvoelt. Enige minpuntje is de vier trappen. @Jennifer was very good at communicating with us prior to our arrival. Although she could not meet with us herself, she had a friend meet with us to give us the keys and more information when we arrived. She was also very accommodating with our flight schedule and check out. _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The apartment was great overall, although just a little smaller than we expected from the pictures. Our favorite part was of course the skylight and dart board she had hanging. The apartment was in clean condition when we arrived, which is always a good thing!_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>The location was amazing, close to everything, a great place to stay for our first visit to New York.  It is on the top floor, so we definitely got our workout in going up and down those stairs each day! _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>We had a blast! _x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Thanks Jennifer! _x000D_<br/>@I love this space.  It is truly a gem in the heart of Manhattan.  The location could not be better.  Very clean, comfy, and great warm inviting energy.  Jennifer was very clear and responsive.@This was our first Airbnb experience, and Jennifer really made it great! No more hotels for us in the future ;) The communication was friendly and she replied very fast. Just great!!@Great location, in the middle of everything. The apartment is well maintained and clean. Jennifer is very responsive to texts/messages. I had a great time there.@Jennifer was without doubt an amazing host, she was incredibly kind and welcoming and made sure we had a great weekend. She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I\\'m in NY!@Jennifer was an unbelievable host! Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>I love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Size wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Lastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It\\'s clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.@The Midtown Castle was a great choice for our weekend stay. It is centrally located, and walking distance for most of our stops. The apartment was clean, nicely decorated, and the perfect size for our trip. Jennifer was a great host, and made our self check-in very easy! She gave us all of the information we needed for a smooth trip.  I would highly recommend this place to other visitors, and would consider staying there again when we are back in NYC!@Tiene una ubicaciÃ³n excelente. Buen equipamiento del apartamento. Tal cual se ve en las fotos@Jennifer is a gracious host with an amazing one of a kind space you won\\'t find anywhere in Mid Manhattan.<br/><br/>The perfect home away from home esp. if you\\'re on business.<br/><br/>Note, the stair climb is LEGIT, not fake news. Jennifer is an excellent communicator with very helpful and clear directions,<br/><br/>The 4 flights of stairs will definitely let you know you\\'re in NYC :)@Jennifer was super friendly and helpful. Great host with an amazing studio apartment right in the middle of NYC. Everything is walking distance! The Empire State Building, Times Square, and New York library were all around the corner or less than 15 minutes walk. Best location ever and great relaxing place to stay.<br/><br/>Quick note: Apartment is located on the 4th floor with no elevator so make sure you donâ€™t have very heavy luggage. In any case itâ€™s a good workout :)@Jennifer\\'s space was such a lovely experience. PreCheckin and checkin was detailed and seamless, she made it easier on us and answered all questions so quickly. The space itself is such a unique, clear & zen energy- we loved it. Not to mention it was very clean & close to everything! Definitely be prepared for the 4flight workout (we appreciated that)! We enjoyed the space and location & would recommend this to anyone coming to explore the city!!@This is a nice apartment and it looks like in the photo. It is well located and Jennifer was very nice and super responsive! She also let me have a late check out at no extra cost, which was very kind of her. 5 stars for that! On the negative side, it was rather cold in the room. I stayed there for 6 nights end of November, beginning of December so the central heating should be on, but it only worked occasionally (this is a building from (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) and the amenities are a bit worn and probably never have been updated). There is an extra heater but it is not sufficient to heat up the room cause the ceiling is high and the glas roof is not a good insulation. Consequently for the majority of the time the temperature inside was between (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) C) which was disagreeable. Second point was the noise from 3 construction sites in the street, one just opposite the building. They started work early and the clearing of rubble was sometimes done past midnight and very loud. Once the heating problem is sorted out and the construction is done it will be a nice place to stay.@Beautiful and stylish spot in a very unique building! Jennifer is a wonderful host and was kind enough to meet us for out late-night check-in. We loved the apartment!@Location Location Location.<br/>Outstanding location near to everything walking, by train or bus.<br/>We enjoy our rent there.<br/><br/>Alonso@Great place. Would definitely recommend! Jennifer is really sweet and easy going.@We really enjoyed our stay at Jenniferâ€™s apartment. She was very hospitable and answered any questions we had promptly. The hike up the four flights of stairs with the luggage was a challenge. <br/>The location was amazing. Central to everything, 5 min walk to the subway, close to time square. There was a bit of noise at night from all the construction happening around the apartment but Jennifer supplied us with ear plugs which worked a treat. Would highly recommend her apartment@This apartment is convenient and functional.  The huge skylight makes it feel open and airy. And it is located smack dab in the middle of Manhattan.  Highly recommended.@The Midtown Castle is a beautiful place to stay in the center of the city.  Truly a sanctuary with everything you need. Little touches of nature and beauty throughout. Waking up with the sun from the skylight was amazing. @Jennifer is very nice and responsive. The location of the apt is great. However <br/>- the bed was small and smelly. The apt also smelled weird. We had to sleep on a mattress on the floor<br/>- the building is very old. <br/>- the apt is not clean and due to construction it was very noisy. <br/><br/>However. We do appreciate the stay and the location@Jennifer es un anfitriÃ³n increÃ\\xadble. Siempre estuvo comunicada y dejÃ³ listos todos los detalles para que mi estancia fuera perfecta. Me sentÃ\\xad como en casa.<br/>El departamento es maravilloso, con mucha luz y una sensaciÃ³n de tranquilidad, ademÃ¡s de una ubicaciÃ³n inmejorable, justo en el centro de Manhattan!! A unos pasos del Empire State. Totalmente recomendable!!@Awesome location, spotless, wonderfully accommodating host. I will definitely stay here next time I am in NYC@The location made getting to Time Square easily accessible. Apartment was quiet and no disturbances from neighbors at all.@Jenniferâ€™s place is a wonderful retreat in the middle of the busy city. The bed was super comfy- and the whole space/energy of the place felt very calm and cozy. You can hear some noise in the street (I expected this because you are literally in the heart of the city) but I slept like the proverbial baby every night. Jennifer was kind enough to leave ear plugs in case we needed them but we never did. I definitely recommend her place!@Great place to stay, very good host@Jenniferâ€™s place is beautiful, cozy and very well located. We were able to walk to every key point of the city from here.  The studio is very clean and spacious.  Thank you for your hospitality. We had an amazing time in NYC!<br/><br/>Best regards,<br/><br/>Lili & Tad@Fantastic location, great communication and a really special space. We would definitely stay again.@Jenniferâ€™s place was amazing! My husband and I spent a weekend in NYC for our anniversary and it was an absolute blast! Jenniferâ€™s place is gorgeous and we really felt at home there. We will definitely stay again!<br/><br/>Make sure you like stairs! ðŸ˜œ@Great space in a fun old building in NYC. Loved the lighting options for the space and the skylight.@The apartment met expectations to how it was insinuated on the ad. Jennifer is very welcoming and friendly. A little pricey for a <500 sq ft space, but it is a convenient location. If you don\\'t want to walk up a 4 story stair case after an already long day of walking, this place is not for you.@10 / 10 would stay again@Place was so cute and comfy! Host was great and was quick to communicate when I had questions. Quick walk to the subway and only about 5 min walk to the Empire State Building. Overall great stay and host was amazing!@I\\'m glad I stayed here. I liked everything.<br/>The apartment is quite spacious and comfortable with an extraordinary glass roof.<br/>A beautiful reflection of the Empire State Building can be seen in the window.<br/>Excellent location in the center of Manhattan, a few minutes walk to the excellent Bryant Park and to the Whole Foods Market.<br/>Jeniffer is very friendly, on the last day when my flight was delayed  she was not against my late check out. I appreciate it.@First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didnâ€™t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. <br/><br/>For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. <br/>The place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. <br/>The kitchen was clean and well equipped. <br/>Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. <br/><br/>Also, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion.@Great location, convenient to everything. Very cool space and building.@Jennifer\\'s apartment is a well-cared for studio in the heart of midtown Garment District, just a few blocks from Bryant Park. The huge skylight is so nice. The quality of light in the early afternoon is idyllic. It has a casual vibe with sound healing instruments, a bean bag chair, and eclectic decÃ³r. The A.C. works great. Jennifer was very friendly and inviting.<br/><br/>Midtown is well-known for its business + tourist vibe. The theatre district is a short walk away. Restaurants are plentiful, though the food is geared towards fast and American. I ate better when I just went for the higher end restaurants, as the quality of the others is questionable. (Hidden by Airbnb) reviews of restaurants in the area are inflated. Korea town is a few blocks away and has some better options. Check out Tonchin (best ramen), Fine & Rare (live jazz), and further north, Tao (cavernous Asian Fusion restaurant with a colossal Buddha statue), for unforgettable dining experiences. Culture on 38th is the best coffee shop around.<br/><br/>The apartment has no blackout curtains so expect a good amount of light 24/7. If you\\'re light sensitive like me, this can be a problem. I slept with a sleep mask every night. Thankfully it wasn\\'t noisy at night, other than the occasional garbage truck.<br/><br/>Lastly, something that Jennifer worked valorously to correct, but you should be aware of, is that there is a light odor from the pipes in the bathroom sometimes. The only way to tame the beast is to keep the fan on continuously, otherwise it becomes overwhelming. Hopefully she can get to the root of the problem, and it may be completely fixed soon after I write this review.<br/><br/>Overall, Jennifer\\'s apartment is a unique find that will be a welcome escape from busy, touristy midtown. I especially recommend it for those who are not light- and smell-sensitive, and who like a casual space instilled with positive intentions.@Simple place, super nice guy.@Great guy with a basic room. Clean sheets and towels. No hangs-ups, come and go as you please. The neighborhood was fine, mix of everybody. Came back around 3am one night without any problems. The place is not immaculate, but neat.@Garon gave me the opportunity to share some of his creative,artistic way of living and being open for assistance getting around in Brooklyn.Also with his room mate I had fine conversations. To find out about busy lifes of my hosts was important during my stay.Creative travelers will anjoy his company._x000D_<br/>Gisela from Bremen, Germay@garon is a sweet person with a lot of knowledge about brooklyn. @Garon - your home was very cozy and comfortable, and your cats very sweet!@We had a lovely stay at Garon\\'s although he wasn\\'t there because he had to work in Italy..._x000D_<br/>He was very nice, sending us emails to let us know about stuff to do in Brooklin...We discovered some great places and met very nice people for new year\\'s eve thanks to Garon!_x000D_<br/>Nice home and sweet cats as well!_x000D_<br/>Cheers and happy new year!@was my first time with airbnb, I enjoy the stay with Garon.

Sean.@I can definately recommend Garon\\'s place. he\\'s a great host- always willing to help and to share experiences, at the same time he gives you enough space for yourself, in a way that gives you the feeling of being totally respected and welcome._x000D_<br/>two cute cats and very friendly neighbours that\\'ll help you if you have problems with new yorker doors and keys._x000D_<br/>Franzi@Where do I start with Garon?  We stayed with him for 3 months and enjoyed every minute of our stay.  We felt more than welcome and treated the place as our own.  He did more for us than I imagined and we became great friend. He gave us advice as people who had never spent long periods in the city and help us out any way he could.  The apartment is clean and cosy with a laid back feel. WeI will stay with him again the next time I am in NY.  Thanks Garon!@Garon is a very warm and friendly guy, willing to help and with a very open personality. The cats are cute, they leave some hair but if you\\'re OK with that, you\\'ll have a pleasant stay. The neighborhood is really cool and kind of hip-hop, with friendly people sitting in front of their houses. If you\\'re lucky Garon can take you to some cool and incrowd places. All in all: Go to BedStuy and enjoy your stay.@Garon was very open and helpful, we felt very welcome and right at home.@Garon was like an angel! He got back to us quickly when we were really in need of a room. When we arrived he made us buckwheat pancakes and made us feel very much at home. He had lots of advice to give as far as what the city had to offer. Highly recommend him, we will surely be back to visit again.@We had a great time here!  Garon was extremely friendly.  We felt comfortable and had lots of privacy.  The only downfall was that the subway can be a pain sometimes (not the fault of the apartment or Garon)!  I would stay here again.@Many thanks to Garon for a wonderful stay. He was very accommodating throughout the entire week that I stayed in his home which has a cosy and creative vibe.  I am so happy that I had the opportunity to stay in such an interesting area.  The subway is close and there are a few little cafes nearby that I loved. You must go to Mrs Daliah\\'s Cafe for cucumber lemonade! I got to meet another traveler staying there, who I hung out with, so that was cool. Also Garon\\'s cats are so adorable. All in all, I highly recommend the Bliss Art Space. Cheers!@WELLL... Firstly Garon is a gemmm... Full of spirit and good sense... I felt welcomed, and definitely at home, i settled in with space in the cuboards,fridge and freezer... The cats, well i loved them to... Probably the only cats i will like that much i certainly miss them, The room was perfect for my end of summer stay, air con, cool, and  cosy =] The place is very typically New York, which i loved. I felt the area Bedford Nostrand was perfect for location, Train like 3 minutes walk and it was great for everywhere i wanted to get to...local shops were fine and i felt perfectly safe and enjoyed my three weeks... I MISSS ITTT and want to be back!!! Garon, Thank you... =]@Wonderfully, nice guy and a great host! This is definetly a space for a more creative person and would highly recommend this for a real New York Experience!!@I stayed at Garons for almost three months and had a wonderful time. His house felt like home, the room really was my place. Garon is very relaxed and a great roommate. We both led our lives and just saw each other when we both were at home. We had some great talks and he\\'s a very inspiring person. His cats were also a great addition to me feeling very at home there. _x000D_<br/>There are a lot of nice nieghbors, and in the neighborhood, there are new cafes and restaurants popping up. It\\'s close to the G-train which connects you to anywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattan. _x000D_<br/>I wish I didn\\'t had to leave!_x000D_<br/>@Garon is very sweet, relaxed and laid back. I felt like an additional room mate! I felt safe walking home to the flat at night, and the flat is easy accessible to JFK. Thanks Garon, I had a lovely time! x@Garon was a very nice host and he let us feel like home in his place, despite we didn\\'t see him during our 6 days stay._x000D_<br/>But unfortunately the apartment was absolutely not like pictures and description on the website: not very clean, and most of all very old, cheap and untidy. The room was too small and a lot of stuffs inside (closet was full) for a 2 persons 6 days stay._x000D_<br/>In our opinion it\\'s not really a rentable place, even if Garon\\'s neighboor was very nice and helpfull, and even if Garon warned us about the possible untidyness in the place because of his absence.@i really enjoyed NY. Garon was so welcoming and tried to give me infos. _x000D_<br/>his house is not brand new but he always keeping clean and tidy. _x000D_<br/>this room has enough space and so brighten.  _x000D_<br/>and i miss cute cats too. :)_x000D_<br/>@Garon is the best. Period.@Everything was perfectly fine! Me and my friend have stayed at Garon\\'s place for 10 days and we really enjoyed that. The apartment is full of interesting stuff and Garon\\'s stories. Garon himself is one of the most laid back persons I have ever met. And cats gave the place a lot of charm and a \"warm touch\". Each of us had his own key and we were free to come and go as we wish - no hassle at all!_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>A neighbourhood is nice. Manhattan is approx. 20min away - close to nothing! A lot of places to eat out -  I could recommend to anyone who plans to stay there to visit a food place right on the right of McDo, close to the A/C subway station - a great deal of specialities straight from Trynidad! =)@Thanks Garon! - I stayed for just over 2 weeks everything was fine, easy going, free reign of the flat pretty much._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Whilst at first I thought the neighbourhood was not so good, It is safe and I was out a fair amount at night. The G and C are close by (the G\\'s a little closer and you can easily change to the L to get to lower manhattan)_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Anyway, if you are considering this then you should defo go for it, for the price I don\\'t think there would be anything better!@Garon is great! He s a really nice and interesting guy!_x000D_<br/>The neighbourhood is great. The apartment is close to subway. Its really safety and nice. Just go there!!_x000D_<br/>@I had the most beautiful stay, _x000D_<br/>Garon is a very special person and an absolute angel, made me feel totally at home in a highly peaceful and relaxed environment, _x000D_<br/>I throughly recommend Bliss Art Space!_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>Aleesha :) @It was so nice staying at Garon\\'s! For the first glance it didn\\'t look very fancy or something, but this place is gorgeous from inside out. It\\'s pretty easy to get to subway G train or if you walk a little more you can get to A train which goes directly to JFK airport. Garon is a very kind person, very open-minded and friendly! We also have a lot in common in area of culture! I\\'ll recommend this place to everyone who is open-minded and want to feel how people live there in NYC. Neighborhood looked safe. Despite it was one of the coldest weeks for last year in town, but heating worked well and the room was warm!@Garon is one of the coolest individuals I\\'ve met in a long time. The room is great close to both the G and A C trains, and the neighborhood has an  organic market right around the corner. Laundry is close by also. There are two beautiful cats that lounge around all day adding to the chillness of the place. There is a sage like wisdom that Garon  imparts with any newbie to NY, and I am a far better New Yorker and individual for meeting this cool cat. _x000D_<br/>@Garon is undoubtedly the most welcoming and nice host ever. You feel at home right away, he is exciting and passionate, discussions are super interesting and he is extremely friendly. A stay at his place is a good mood cure. I highly recommend!@Had a great stay with Garon! You\\'ll have a super cool and helpful roommate for the length of your stay, who just might cook you breakfast and make you tea in the morning. The neighborhood is really interesting and beautiful, worth spending some time just wandering around. I stayed for almost two weeks, often coming back late at night, and never felt unsafe in the area. The room itself has everything you need. And the apartment has two friendly cats :). If I were to come back to Brooklyn, I would definitely stay with Garon again.@Great, perfect ;) @I had a good feeling about Garon before I arrived and was not disappointed at all.  I tried to keep busy and didn\\'t want to be in his way. My stay was quite lengthy so we did have a lot of time to sit and chat about so many things and had a lot of laughs._x000D_<br/>_x000D_<br/>I\\'m already planning to go back and I will try to stay with Garon again and again, the space, location and host are all a perfect match for me.@Garon Ã¨ davvero una persona meravigliosa! Grazie per le chiacchere, il the allo zenzero e i tanti consigli che mi sono stati dati! davvero una persona speciale da incontrare e dove alloggiare a NYC! @Garon is an accommodating, friendly, and helpful host. The room seemed smaller than the pictures indicated. The bed is on the floor.@Garon is a great guy, very friendly and easygoing, as well as trustworthy!!! I really liked staying at his place for five nights. He gave me useful advices about what I should visit in NY and we had cool conversations about everyday life! Furthermore, his place is located very close to 2 metro stations and it takes only 20-30 minutes to reach Manhattan! I strongly recommend staying at his place!@Garon was a generous and helpful host. His accommodations are clean and cozy. He even invited me to dance at his second reception! It was truly a pleasure to meet him and stay in his home.@Best choice ever made, really confortable bed, quite room and in really brooklyn astmosfer...close to metro!_x000D_<br/>But most important, meet Garon :) @Garon is one of the best hostes I eber had! He is such a easygoing person. He welcomed me very warm  and friendly. He recommended me local spots to visit and helpt and was there for any questions. I definitive recommend to stay at Garons place. <br/><br/>Thank you so much Garon!  @I enjoyed my stay with Garon! He is a kind and considerate host, the room and apartment are very comfortable, and his cats are very friendly.@Garon is an amazing host, very welcoming. He showed me the house and gave me tips for my stay in NYC. The room was nice and the bed comfortable. The area is very safe, even at night, full of nice restaurants, pubs and cafe.
