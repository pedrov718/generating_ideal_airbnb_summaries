good experience but if what you care about the most be a great location then this be the place for you the picture be a good reference of what to expect although simply add an unpleasant layer of

it be right next to the trash room so open the door you smell the trash and it can be pretty disgusting however the inside of the apartment smell fine i appreciate that the room be independent of the owner 's space as a door separate the room and the bathroom from the living room and the owner 's room it be also very convenient that the room come with a fridge microwave toaster and even plate and cutlery it be pleasantly large and the bed be more of a full sized futon the a c work but not very well which be not an inconvenience unless one come in the summertime like i do our host provide we with a room key so it be nice to be able to lock the room and feel my stuff would not be disturb i do not really see much of the owner as a friend of his welcome i when i arrive and i believe that if i have not proceed to ask he a few question the one day i see he at the apartment we might never have talk as he always leave before i do and arrive apparently after however the main thing about this apartment be the location incredible location it be walk distance from   columbus circle and all the theater area and times square which make it very convenient when i get out of a play late at night there be also a number of grocery store nearby include an organic whole food style one there be nearby subway station and ton of restaurant so it be easy to find anything one might need within a few blocks.\",\n 'perfect location for the show i be seeing- thank to the host for offer this.',\n \"the person host 's friend that be suppose to let we in the apartment at the schedule time be not there

receive we due to the fact that his friend never show up he apologize and be quick to prepare the room honestly the fact that we have to wait be not that big of a deal hiccup happen but the fact that after he prepare the room it continue to look messy and dirty be kind of disappointing to all of you look to stay in nyc be aware of pros and cons of this listing pro location be excellent good neighborhood very close to central park by columbus circle lot of nice restaurant and shop nearby this be what this listing be about also he provide with map hairdryer sun screen scissor and that kind of essential there be a small work fridge instant coffee microwave and tv which i do not know if they work never use they   cons on the other hand the room and bathroom be really dirty mostly the bathroom guy i have to grab a cleaning brush and a bottle of clean product that be next to the toilet to clean the bathtub floor because i do not dare to put my foot there consider on how the rest of the bathroom look the sheet look clean but we do not dare to use the towel we just use small one that we pack just in case the cover on the small sofa be also pretty nasty honestly this be not a place to stay more than one night and that be why we decide to stay after see all this if it would have be more that one night we would have go to our friend 's house in new jersey which it have have ruin all our plan bottom line if you do not mind stay relatively cheap in the middle of the city in a dirty place this the listing to do so at least neighborhood be safe otherwise go to a different place you got to be a care free person to stay in a place like this and have see many dirty place to assimilate this i come from a dirty 3rd world country so there be that but never expect this in an air

negatives:_x000d_<br/>our last night there wireless internet go out   out of their control as they lose their residential phone internet cable upstairs as usual twc suck and they obviously want it fix more than we do   the tv in the room as i see in the photo be a very small oldschool tv vcr combo not a problem for i but perhaps for other   the apartment be obviously furnish by people rather than by ikea which i prefer but some may not like   x000d_<br/>_x000d_<br/>overall i be glad we stay here rather than one of the hotel toshi property which have nice stuff big flatscreen tv 's ultramodern
